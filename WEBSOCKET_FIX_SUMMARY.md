# WebSocket Import and Build Issues Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The Netlify build was failing with the error:
```
Could not resolve "./webSocketService" from "src/services/astralTetherService.ts"
```

## Root Cause
**Case sensitivity mismatch between Windows and Linux:**
- Git was tracking the file as `websocketService.ts` (all lowercase)
- The actual file on disk was `webSocketService.ts` (camelCase)
- Imports were using `./webSocketService` (camelCase)
- Windows is case-insensitive, so it worked locally
- Linux (Netlify's build environment) is case-sensitive, causing the build to fail

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed File Name Case Sensitivity
```bash
git mv src/services/websocketService.ts src/services/webSocketService.ts
```
This corrected the git tracking to match the actual file name and imports.

### 2. Created Simplified Build Script
Created `scripts/netlify-simple-build.js` to handle the build process more reliably:
- Uses `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` to bypass peer dependency conflicts
- Runs `npx vite build` directly
- Creates `_redirects` file for SPA routing
- Provides clear error messages and build status

### 3. Updated Build Configuration
Modified `package.json`:
- Added `build:netlify` script pointing to the simplified build
- Kept other build scripts as fallbacks

Updated `netlify.toml`:
- Changed build command from `vite build` to `npm run build:netlify`
- Applied to both main build and production context

## Files Modified
1. `src/services/webSocketService.ts` - Fixed case in git tracking
2. `scripts/netlify-simple-build.js` - Created new simplified build script
3. `package.json` - Updated build scripts
4. `netlify.toml` - Updated build commands

## Verification Steps
1. Build runs successfully locally with `npm run build:netlify`
2. No import resolution errors in the build output
3. Git properly tracks the file with correct casing

## Additional Notes
- The peer dependency conflict between `openai` and `zod` is bypassed using `--legacy-peer-deps`
- The build process is now more resilient to environment differences
- Case sensitivity issues are resolved for Linux deployment

## Next Steps for Deployment
1. Commit all changes:
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Fix WebSocket import case sensitivity and simplify Netlify build"
   ```
2. Push to repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin master
   ```
3. Netlify should automatically trigger a new build with the fixes

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Local build succeeds
- [x] File case sensitivity fixed in git
- [x] Build script handles dependencies properly
- [x] Vite build completes without errors
- [ ] Netlify deployment succeeds (pending push)
