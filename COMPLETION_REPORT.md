     - Assessments
     - Safety plans
     - Journal entries
     - Crisis resources
   - API is running and accessible at `http://localhost:9999/.netlify/functions/api`

2. **Created Backend Service Layer**
   - Built `backendService.ts` to connect frontend to API
   - Integrated mood tracking with backend
   - Added offline-first approach (saves locally, syncs to backend)

## üöß ONGOING ISSUES

### Build Issues (CRITICAL)
- **JSX Transformation Error**: SwipeNavigationContext.tsx still has esbuild issues
- **Error**: `Expected "}" but found ":"` at line 142
- **Impact**: Production build fails, preventing deployment

### Missing Features (HIGH PRIORITY)
1. **Authentication**: Auth0 configured but not working
2. **Database**: No real database connection (using mock data)
3. **Crisis Detection**: Services exist but not connected
4. **AI Chat**: UI exists, no backend integration
5. **Real-time Features**: WebSocket not configured
6. **PWA**: Service worker partially working

- ‚úÖ API health check endpoint working
- ‚úÖ Basic layout and styling fixed
- ‚úÖ Mobile responsive design implemented
- ‚úÖ Mood tracking connected to backend (saves successfully)

### What's Not Working:
- ‚ùå Production build fails (JSX issues)
- ‚ùå Cannot deploy to production
- ‚ùå Authentication flow broken

## üéØ NEXT STEPS (Priority Order)

### IMMEDIATE (Next 2 hours):
1. **Fix JSX Build Error**
   - Simplify all ternary operators in JSX
   - Consider switching to Babel instead of esbuild
   - Or use webpack for production builds

2. **Complete Production Build**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # Should complete without errors
   ```

3. **Deploy to Netlify**
   ```bash
   netlify deploy --prod
   ```

### SHORT TERM (Next 24 hours):
1. **Set up Neon Database**
   - Create account at neon.tech
   - Set up PostgreSQL database
   - Update DATABASE_URL in .env
   - Create schema migrations

2. **Fix Authentication**
   - Complete Auth0 integration
   - Add proper callback handling
   - Implement protected routes
   - Add user registration flow

3. **Connect Core Features**

   - Journal functionality
   - Crisis resource access

### MEDIUM TERM (Next Week):
1. **AI Integration**
   - Set up Gemini API
   - Implement chat backend
   - Add safety filters

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

Before deploying to production:
- [ ] Fix all build errors
- [ ] Set up production database
- [ ] Configure production environment variables
- [ ] Enable HTTPS
- [ ] Set up monitoring
- [ ] Test on mobile devices
- [ ] Run accessibility audit
- [ ] Security review
- [ ] Load testing
- [ ] Backup strategy

## üìà METRICS & SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Technical Metrics:
- Build Success: ‚ùå FAILING
- API Response: ‚úÖ < 100ms
- Page Load: ‚úÖ < 2s (dev)
- Mobile Score: ‚ö†Ô∏è 70/100
- Accessibility: ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial

### Feature Completion:
- Core Features: 30% complete
- Backend Integration: 20% complete
- Mobile Optimization: 60% complete
- Production Ready: 40% complete

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL RISKS

1. **No Production Build** - Cannot deploy until JSX errors fixed
2. **No Database** - All data is temporary/mock
3. **No Auth** - Anyone can access everything
4. **No Crisis Detection** - Safety features not working
5. **Not HIPAA Compliant** - No encryption or security

---

## üìù RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Fix the build** - Top priority
2. **Deploy MVP** - Get something live
3. **Add database** - Make data persistent
4. **Enable auth** - Secure the application

### Strategic Decisions:
1. Consider using **Next.js** instead of Vite for better production builds
2. Use **Supabase** instead of custom backend for faster development
3. Implement **Clerk** instead of Auth0 for simpler auth
4. Deploy to **Vercel** instead of Netlify for better Next.js support
