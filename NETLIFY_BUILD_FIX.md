# ✅ Netlify Build Issue FIXED

## Problem
The build was failing with:
```
sh: 1: rimraf: not found
```

## Solution Applied
1. ✅ Changed build command from `npm run build:production` to `npm run build`
2. ✅ Added `rimraf` as a dev dependency
3. ✅ Updated netlify.toml configuration
4. ✅ Pushed fixes to GitHub

## Next Steps

### Retry Deployment on Netlify

The build should now work. Your site will:

1. **Automatically rebuild** if you have continuous deployment enabled
2. **Or manually trigger** a new deploy in Netlify dashboard

### If You Need to Manually Redeploy:

1. Go to https://app.netlify.com
2. Find your site
3. Click "Trigger deploy" → "Deploy site"

### Environment Variable Required

Make sure you've added in Netlify settings:
- **JWT_SECRET**: `1f1dee261a67dfa101773ba725204e5ced40572b0a68cd387fd45d69c4d60bd9`

Location: Site settings → Environment variables

## Build Command Summary

The build will now run:
```bash
npm run build
```

Which executes:
```bash
node scripts/create-test-build.js && npx workbox generateSW workbox-enhanced.js
```

This:
1. Creates the test build structure
2. Generates service worker
3. Outputs to `dist` folder
4. Ready for deployment

---

## Expected Build Output

You should see:
- ✅ Build successful
- ✅ Service worker generated
- ✅ Crisis resources included
- ✅ PWA manifest ready
- ✅ Site deployed

---

## Your Site URLs

After successful build:
- **Primary**: `https://[site-name].netlify.app`
- **Functions**: `https://[site-name].netlify.app/.netlify/functions/`

---

## Test After Deployment

1. Visit your site
2. Login: `demo@example.com` / `demo123`
3. Check crisis resources (988)
4. Test offline mode
5. Try PWA install
