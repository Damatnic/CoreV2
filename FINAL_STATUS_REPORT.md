## üìù FINAL NOTES

The CoreV2 Mental Health Platform has been successfully rescued from a non-functional state to a deployable application. While not all features are complete, the foundation is solid and the critical blocking issues have been resolved.

**Key Achievement:** The production build that was completely failing now completes successfully, and the site that was visually broken now displays correctly on both desktop and mobile.

**Recommendation:** Deploy to staging immediately for user testing while continuing development of remaining features in parallel.
