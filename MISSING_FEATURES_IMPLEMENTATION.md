     // Basic API structure
   }
   ```

2. **Create Database Schema**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE users (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
     email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
     role VARCHAR(50),
     created_at TIMESTAMP
   );
   
   CREATE TABLE mood_entries (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
     user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
     mood_score INTEGER,
     notes TEXT,
     created_at TIMESTAMP
   );
   ```

3. **Fix Authentication Flow**

- [ ] Users can register and login
- [ ] Mood tracking saves to database
- [ ] Crisis resources are accessible
- [ ] Safety plan can be created and saved
- [ ] Basic assessment tools work
- [ ] Offline mode for crisis resources
- [ ] Mobile responsive design
- [ ] WCAG AA compliance

### Full Production:
- [ ] All features listed above implemented
- [ ] Real-time features working
- [ ] AI chat integrated
- [ ] Push notifications active
- [ ] Analytics dashboard
- [ ] Admin panel
- [ ] Full test coverage

- Auth0: Free tier (7,000 users)
- Gemini AI: ~$50/month
- Netlify: ~$19/month
- Monitoring: ~$20/month
- **Total: ~$109/month**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items:
1. **No backend = No functionality**
2. **Crisis detection failures = Safety risk**
3. **Data breaches = Privacy violations**
4. **Poor mobile experience = Inaccessible during crisis**
5. **Slow performance = User abandonment**

### Mitigation Strategies:
1. Implement backend immediately
2. Add fallback crisis resources
3. Encrypt sensitive data
4. Mobile-first development
5. Performance monitoring

## üìä Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics:
- API response time < 200ms
- Page load time < 2s
- 99.9% uptime
- Zero data breaches
- 90+ Lighthouse score

### User Metrics:
- User registration rate
- Daily active users
- Mood tracking compliance
- Crisis resource usage
- User retention (30-day)

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **STOP** trying to fix UI issues
2. **START** building the backend
3. **FOCUS** on one feature end-to-end
4. **TEST** with real users
5. **ITERATE** based on feedback

**Time Estimate:** 210+ hours of development needed
**Recommendation:** Hire backend developer or use Backend-as-a-Service
**Priority:** Backend > Auth > Crisis > Core Features > Polish
